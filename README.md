# matcha
A CLI epub reader for Linux with inline image support

- Depends on links, python3, imagemagick, unzip, xterm
- Requires a terminal with support for sixels (e.g. Xterm -ti vt340)

Tested in Alpine Linux and Debian GNU/Linux with Xterm using the Ash shell and Bash shell
I've currently only tested it on two different books however, so it may not work for you. 
I wrote this because I wanted an epub reader that I could use in the terminal, and still be able to view images. Sixels with imagemagick were the only way I could get inline images to work properly, and it was pretty convenient so I stuck with it. 
There's a fair few projects called "matcha" already, so I may change the name sometime.
